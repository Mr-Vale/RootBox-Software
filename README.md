# 🌱 RootBox Project

RootBox is a Raspberry Pi–based automated root observation system designed to scan and monitor plant root growth over time. It supports multiple USB flatbed scanners, provides a local web interface for configuration, and logs all activity for future analysis.

## 📦 Features

- Supports **1–6 USB scanners**, each with independent settings
- Automatically scans at user-defined **intervals** and **resolutions**
- Stores images in timestamped files inside per-scanner folders
- Built-in **web GUI** to:
  - Enable/disable scanners
  - Assign scanner labels
  - Set scan frequency and DPI resolution
  - Choose which USB scanner is assigned
  - View the last 50 lines of system logs (collapsible panel)
  - Trigger **manual scans** per scanner
  - Start and stop the scanning controller
- **Desktop shortcut** created on the Pi desktop to launch the web GUI
- Auto-detects connected scanner devices via background service
- Logs system activity in a rotating log file (`logs/control_log.txt`)
- Uses simple **JSON** config files — no database or internet required
- Future expansion: automatic image upload, root tracking via AI

## ⚙️ How to Install

1. Install **Raspberry Pi OS with Desktop**  
   (Make sure it's connected to the internet, SSH enabled and its in the right timezone)
2. SSH into the Pi or open a terminal
3. Run this command:
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mr-Vale/RootBox-Software/main/install.sh)
   ```
4. Wait for installation to complete
5. Reboot the Pi before first use


## 🖥️ Accessing the Web GUI

Once installed either:

- Open a browser and navigate to:
  ```
  http://<raspberry-pi-ip-address>:5000
  ```
OR

- Use Real VNC viewer and log into "Raspberry-Pi-IP" Port 5900				

OR

- Open any browser on the Raspberry Pi
- Navigate to:  
  ```
  http://localhost:5000
  ```

OR use the desktop shortcut:

### 📁 Desktop Shortcut

The installer automatically creates a shortcut on the Raspberry Pi desktop:

- 📌 **RootBox GUI** → double-click to open the web interface in your browser
- It runs:  
  ```
  xdg-open http://localhost:5000
  ```
